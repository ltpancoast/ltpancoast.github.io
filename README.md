## CS499 - Computer Science Capstone


### Professional Self-assessment
	When I was in fourth grade my family bought our first computer. Ever since then, I have been an avid enthusiast of everything 
related to computers: software, hardware, programming, you name it. With that first computer, and while still in elementary school, I 
learned how to type extremely well, and how to navigate, customize, (break,) and fix the operating system. Before middle school was 
over, I was taking apart computers, swapping components, remotely controlling friend’s computers (non-malicious pranks, of course), and 
programming simple web pages. It wasn’t until early in my adulthood that I began having the desire to pursue this passion as a career. 
More specifically, out of the various programming ventures I have undertaken, there have been some that have really made an impact with 
past (and current) employers. Seeing something I had programmed have a meaningful impact on a business really made want to do it full-
time; with that, I began applying for jobs. Unfortunately for me (however understandable), most employers wanted a formal education for 
those applying for Software Engineer positions. Despite the years of self-learning and albeit small, collection of software projects 
being actively used, it appeared that without a degree I would have a hard time of pursing my goal of becoming a Software Engineer. 
Thus, began my journey at SNHU.
	My adventure in the Computer Science program at SNHU has accomplished many things for me both on personal and professional 
levels. In a technical sense, I have learned and grown to love new programming languages like Python and Java. I’ve learned how to 
create server-side applications and use non-relational databases, like MongoDB. I’ve had the opportunity to gain exposure to the 
emerging fields of AI and ML, and create simple applications utilizing those technologies. I’ve learned the means and importance, of 
testing and debugging as well as, writing clean, semantic, re-usable and maintainable code. Of the many experiences in my time at SNHU, 
one of the most important, intangible, aspects I’ve grown to appreciate is collaborating in a team environment specifically, how to be 
an effective contributor. As a project’s size and complexity increases, so does the need for teamwork. Similarly, as a project changes 
and/or evolves, collaboration with management and the clients are also vital. While I have learned many new topics, technologies, and 
theologies in regard to the field of computer science, my experience has also been humbling. While I would have considered myself as 
have knowing a lot about computers prior to attending SNHU, my experience here has revealed that even after all of my courses, I have 
only scratched the surface of computer science.  I’ve come to learn, that being a software engineer is a process of evolution; I began 
that journey many years ago but, SNHU has helped to make me more well-rounded and enhanced my capabilities of seeing the big picture. 
Furthermore, my experiences here at SNHU have also helped affirm the area of Computer Science I wish to be a part of, cyber security. 
Some of the topics covered in the program, including but not limited to, hash algorithms and cryptography, gave me new insight into how 
security works and has led to my desire for further research into this area.
	As part of my e-portfolio, I have included a code review and enhancements for a software artifact that I created in a previous 
class at SNHU. The enhancements to the artifact were targeted for three specific areas: _Software Design and Engineering_, _Algorithms 
and Data Structures_, and, _Databases_. These documents will help to showcase some of my new, and improved upon, abilities such as: 
using Python, creating a RESTful API, creating server- and client-side components, and using non-relational databases. Additionally, a 
common element of security was applied to reveal my interest in the field.
